<p>
  Hey there, I'm Michelangelo Markus. I once founded my own cloud consultancy
  company and spent a few years as a Solutions Architect at AWS. Now, I'm a
  Senior Cloud Engineering Consultant at an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner.
  I've devoted my career to cloud technology, focusing on AWS, Infrastructure as
  Code (IaC), and pushing research innovations forward.
</p>
<h3 class="text-lg">My Professional Odyssey</h3>
<p>
  During my stint at AWS, I dove deep into cloud solutions and IaC, contributing
  to the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). I helped create the AWS CDK Immersion
  Day, empowering developers globally. You might've seen me at AWS events like
  re:Invent, talking about cost optimization and generative AI in research.
</p>
<h3 class="text-lg">Beyond the Cloud</h3>
<p>
  When I'm not buried in code, I'm probably out in nature, globe-trotting, or
  lost in a book. These escapes keep me sane and add a dash of creativity to my
  work.
</p>
<h3 class="text-lg">Let's Connect</h3>
<p>
  I'm always up for a chat about cloud, tech, research, or even the latest in
  Berlin's food scene. Feel free to connect!
