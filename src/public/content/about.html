<h2 class="text-xl main-title">About me</h2>
<p>
  Hey there, I'm Michelangelo Markus. I once founded Michelangelo Codes LLC and
  spent a few years as a Solutions Architect at AWS. Now, I'm a Senior Cloud
  Engineering Consultant at an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner. I've devoted my
  career to cloud technology, focusing on AWS, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and
  pushing research innovations forward.
</p>
<h3 class="text-lg">My Professional Odyssey</h3>
<p>
  During my stint at AWS, I dove deep into cloud solutions and IaC, contributing
  to the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). I helped create the AWS CDK Immersion
  Day, empowering developers globally. You might've seen me at AWS events like
  re:Invent, talking about cost optimization and generative AI in research.
</p>
<h3 class="text-lg">Beyond the Cloud</h3>
<p>
  When I'm not buried in code, I'm probably out in nature, globe-trotting, or
  lost in a book. These escapes keep me sane and add a dash of creativity to my
  work.

  Got tech ambitions? Let's chat. I'm here to help you navigate the cloud and
  achieve your strategic goals.
